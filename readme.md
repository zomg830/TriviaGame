# JavaScript Assignment 2 - Trivia

### Overview

In this assignment, I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. In addition, I designed the page transitions and CSS to reflect the different themes of each trivia question.

### Theme

The theme for this assignment is mythology; I drew upon three distinct cultures: Greek, Egyptian, and Norse to create the trivia questions used in this game.

### How to Play

Playing the game couldn't be simpler, just click the Start button upon loading in to the landing page. Each page will present one question with four possible answers, you will have 30 seconds to select an answer. There are 12 questions in total, at the end of the game your score will be calculated from the total number of correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions. Upon completion of the game you will be taken back to the starting question. Will you be able to beat your previous high score?
